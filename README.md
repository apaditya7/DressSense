DressSense
Innovation and Inspiration
We all have clothes buried in the back of our closet that we haven't worn in months. Years, even. And yet we keep on buying new clothes to keep up with current trends. Now imagine if there were a way to stay fashionable, whilst also sparing your wallet. What if we could reuse our old, neglected clothes in innovative and unique new ways? DressSense.ai aims to do just that - by creating new, fresh outfits from old, tired clothes.

DressSense is revolutionary in the sense that it takes a completely fresh approach to fashion and sustainaibility. While thrifting is often touted to be 'green', reusing your own old clothes is just as good if not better since these are often clothes that will be disposed off otherwise. Through this, users are encouraged to make the most of what they own, which can have several positive environmental benefits in the long run.

What it does
Essentially, DressSense is a personal stylist that aims to take in a user's preferences and suggest to them the most suitable outfit - based off their existing clothes - for their needs. Users will take a picture of the clothes in their wardrobe and the AI will generate permutations of fashionable, practical and unique outfits for them to wear. It helps them visualize outfits, get feedback, and even improve their dressing based off interactive feedback from the in-built chatbot.

How we built it
We used a multifaceted approach for the front-end. We built both a web application as well as a mobile application, to enhance convenience and extensibility for our users. For the backend, we made use of several APIs including Dall-e, Open AI, Google Calendar amongst many others in order to optimise the several functionalities our application offered. Rather than locally hosting the server, we hosted our backend on AWS so as to fully recreate the feel of a 'market-ready' application - after all, our goal is to build something that can actually be used.

How can you access DressSense.ai
